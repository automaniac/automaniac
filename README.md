### Welcome!
My name is Igor and I love to code.<br />
The technologies that I use to develop are Python, Javascript, C, Processing and SQL.<br />
I'm an Informatics Technician from IFAL and I'm now a Control and Automation Engineering student at UFPE.<br />
I speak Portuguese, English and am currently learning French! :)
