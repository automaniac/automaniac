### Welcome!
My name is Igor and I love to code.<br />
The programming languages that I prefer are Python and Javascript.<br />
Also, I already worked with Java, HTML, PHP, C, Processing and SQL technologies.<br />
I'm an Informatics Technician from IFAL and I'm now a Control and Automation Engineering student at UFPE.<br />
I speak Portuguese, English and am currently learning French! :)
